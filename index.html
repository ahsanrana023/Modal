          Pakistan, populous multiethnic country of South Asia. Having a
          predominately Indo-Iranian speaking population, Pakistan has
          historically and culturally been associated with its neighbours Iran,
          Afghanistan, and India. Since Pakistan and India achieved independence
          in 1947, Pakistan has been distinguished from its larger southeastern
          neighbour by its overwhelmingly Muslim population (as opposed to the
          predominance of Hindus in India).
